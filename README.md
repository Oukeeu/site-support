Site recovery in case of unsuccessful changes by other developers

In this case we provided technical support and maintenance of the site, which went down due to incorrect changes in the source code by other developers.

My task was:
1) Identification of the problem.
2) The quickest possible elimination of the problem and its solution.
3) Additional changes to the code of the site.

The problem was detected and solved rather quickly, the customer was satisfied (he needed quick help in solving the problem, because the site was monetary transactions).

The problem was a syntax errors in the code and database conflicts. The solution to all the problems took no more than an hour of work. 
-Edited the code (changed the links leading to the content connection).
-Changed mysql encoding.
-edited urlrewrite to a more current version of the platform the site was on.

Stack:
1) JS
2) HTML
3) CSS
4) PHP
5) MySQL
